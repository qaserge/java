YAHTZEE (Console Game)

The object of the game is to score the most points possible by rolling five dice. 
The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn. 
There are thirteen possible scoring combinations. 
A complete game consists of thirteen rounds. 
During each round the player decides which scoring combination is best suited for that round. 
Once a player uses a scoring combination during a game it cannot be used again by that player.

- Fours: Get as many fours as possible.
- Fives: Get as many fives as possible.

 The score is simply the sum of the dice.

Each player's total score is calculated at the end of the game by summing all thirteen score boxes.
