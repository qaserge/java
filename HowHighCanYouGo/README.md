	console java game
  program	the	dice game:	“How	High	Can	You	Go?” for	a	single player
  
  In	this	game,	the	player	rolls	a	single	dice	and	scores	the	number	rolled	(unless	a	1	is	rolled).
If	a	1	is	rolled,	the	player	loses	all	their	points.	If	points	are	scored,	the	user	can	choose	to	
roll	again	(and	risk	rolling	a	1)	or	stick with	the	number	of	points	accumulated	so	far.
At	each	roll,	your	program	must	display	the	number	rolled	as	well	as	the	current	score.
The	player’s	turn	ends	when	the	player	chooses	to	stop	rolling	(they	score	the	total	number	
of	points	they	have	accumulated)	or	a	1	is	rolled	(the	player	scores	0	points!).
